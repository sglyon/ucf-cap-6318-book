> Spencer Lyon

**Prerequisites**

- None

**Outcomes**

- Remember how to define custom structs in Julia
- Learn to use the Julia REPL
- Learn how to create a custom Julia environment for a project

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

# ABMs in Julia

- We will be defining agent based models in Julia
- Do do this, we need to remember/review a few concepts:
    1. Types in Julia
    2. Evaluating code in REPL
    3. Packages and environments

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

## Review: Julia Types

- Recall how to define a composite type in Julia
```julia
mutable struct NAME <: ABSTRACT_PARENT
   FIELDS
end
```
- Note including `mutable` allows us to change fields after creating an object (important for today's application)
- We can define new methods for an existing function for our type: `isint(::NAME) = false`

# Running Julia Code

- So far we've been running our Julia programs in Jupyter
- This is an extra execution environment we added to our Julia installation
- The default way to run Julia is in the REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop)

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

## REPL

- The REPL typically started either by typing `julia` in a terminal or by clicking on the Julia icon in your Applications list
- Once staretd, we will see a prompt `julia>` where we can enter Julia code
- If we enter code and press `Enter`, the REPL will evaluate the code and print the result

## REPL Modes

- The REPL has a few modes:
    1. Default `julia>` mode: this is where we run Julia code and see output
    2. `shell>` mode: here we can interact with underlying shell/terminal. We activate shell mode with `;`
    3. `help?>` mode: here we can get help on Julia functions. We activate help mode with `?`
    4. `pkg>` mode: here we can interact with Julia packages. We activate pkg mode with `]`

# Packages

- Julia code is structured into packages
- Packages fulfill a few roles
    1. Allow library developers to group+distributed related types and functions
    2. Allow application developers to create an isolated environment for an application
- So far, we have used packages in the first context above: DataFrames.jl, Graphs.jl, and CSV.jl
- Today we will introduce the second one...

## Environments

- Any folder on your computer can be an environment for a Julia package/application
- If a directory has a `Project.toml` file with appropriate contents, it is a Julia environment
- Today we will use htis feature to create an isolated environment for our ABM to make sure we have the right versions of the right packages installedm

## Create a new environment

- To create a new environment, you do the following:
    1. Start Julia in the directory you wish to make into an environment (or use shell mode -- `;` -- to move there)
    2. Enter package mode by pressing `]`
    3. Enter `activate .` to create a new environment in the current directory
    4. While in package mode use `add XXX` to add packages to the environment
- Julia will record all the packages you request as well as their versions
- Other users can then use `] activate .` followed by `instantiate` to install the same packages and versions
