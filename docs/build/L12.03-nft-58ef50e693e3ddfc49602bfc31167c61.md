## Review: Blockchains, Smart contracts, and Tokens

- Over the past few weeks we have learned quite a bit about blockchains and cryptocurrencies
- A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, public ledger
    - Primary application: means of recording transfers of crypto currencies (e.g. BTC)
- Smart contracts as we know them today started with Ethereum
    - Use blockchain to store and execute computer programs
    - Transactions can now include arbitrary logic... *unlimited* potential
- Standards have been developed to allow smart contracts to interact with one another
    - The ERC-20 standard defines what it means to be a "token"
    - There are tens of thousands of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain today (Nov. 2021)
- We learned about decentralized finance (Defi)
    - Systems of smart contracts implement financial primitives (trading, borrowing, insurance, lending, etc.) 
    - These systems operate on the ERC-20 standard, making them composable and flexible
    - Opportunity to define arbitrary financial systems ("I wrote financial systems into existence" Hamilton)
- Today we learn about NFTs...

## NFT??

- NFT stands for **non-fungible token**
- Two parts:
    1. Token: we learned last week... backed by smart contract and can be secured/transferred on blockchain
    1. Non-fungible: adjective meaning cannot be copied, divided, or replaced with something else
- Recall what the USDC token looks like:
    - name: `USD Coin`
    - symbol: `USDC`
    - decimals: 6
- This means if you hold one unit of USDC, you have $1e-6
- Any single unit of USDC is equivalent to any other unit of USDC. You don't care which one you have

### NFT Use Cases

- Art and collectables: [Music by Timbaland](https://decrypt.co/84531/timbaland-ethereum-music-nfts-you-can-remix), [OpenSea Gallary](https://opensea.io/collection/art), [Audius](https://audius.co/)
- Video Games: [Sandbox](https://www.sandbox.game/en/), [AxieInfinity](https://axieinfinity.com/), [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/), [Gala](https://app.gala.games/), [Gods Unchained](https://godsunchained.com/)
- Ownership of Physical goods: car title, home deed, company ownership
- Defi applications: [Liquidity provider positions on Uniswap V3](https://uniswap.org/whitepaper-v3.pdf), smart wallets, debt positions

### History

- There is some debate about where the idea of NFTs on a blockchain originated
- Some key projects that really brought them into the mainstream are:
    - Cryptopunks (early 2017): 10,000 unique, but randomly generated "pixel art" images
    - Cryptokitties (late 2017): buy, breed, sell game that nearly brought ethereum to a halt (caused increase in gas limit)
    - Creation of many NFT platforms (2018-present): [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/), [SuperRare](https://superrare.com), [Rarible](https://rarible.com), [Solanart](https://solanart.io)
    - ERC-721 (January 2018): proposal for formal standard/interface for NFTs on Ethereum
    - Beeple's NFT (early 2021): images from 5,000 days that sold for over $69 million in auction at Christie's auction house

## How it works: ERC-721

- The key interface for describing NFTs
- Too much code to put here, so we'll review key concepts and then check out [OpenZeppelin docs](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#ERC721) on ERC-721
- Key ideas:
    - NFTS are *grouped* into a single smart contract and *referenced* by an integer index `tokenId`
    - Each NFT is owned by exactly one address
    - The address (owner) must approve any other entity to be able to handle the NFT
    - Only one non-owner can be approved at a time
    - If recipient of transfer doesn't know how to handle NFTs, could be lost forever... use `safeTransferFrom` instead of `transferFrom`
    - Extensions to core standard allow associating metadata (images, files, movies, etc.) with token

### High Gas fees

- At times the ethereum blockchain can be very **busy**
- This results in high transaction (gas) fees for doing operations like deploying an ERC-721 smart contract or selling/transferring NFTs
- There are a few ways around this issue:
    - Wait for gas fees to be low
    - Use a "Layer 2" solution (see next slide)
    - Use an alternative blockchain: Solana is currently (Nov. 2022) next most popular for NFTs (see subsequent slides)

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

## Layer 2

- The popularity of the Ethereum blockchain has led to high demand for block space and, as a result, high gas fees
- Since Ethereum was publically released there have been various advancements in theory and technology that allow for lower fees and higher throughput, without sacrificing security
    - Optimistic Rollups
    - Zero knowledge proofs
    - Zero knowledge rollups: 
    - Proof of Stake: no need for high mining reward to offset costs for miners' energy use
- [Video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pWxCklcNsU&t=2s)
- Disclaimer: this space is new and rapdily evolving -- I don't have all the answers!

## Alternative Chains: Solana

- Solana is branded as an "ethereum killer"
- It is an entirely new blockchain built on cutting edge technology
- Currently at over 2000 TPS, but with the capacity to increase that at least two orders of magnitude
- Transaction costs are very low (average less than $0.00025)
- Actively growing ecosystem of dapps in the Defi and NFT spaces

## Example: Class Badge

- Let's close out our semester by creating some NFTs!
- Goal: create an NFT signifying successful completion of the course
- Steps:
    - Google Chrome (or [Brave](https://brave.com/))
    - Metamask wallet browser extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en
    - Add polygon network: https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/metamask/config-polygon-on-metamask/
    - Create logo: https://looka.com/
    - Create NFT on [opensea](https://opensea.io)
    - Claim NFT after we create it (or send me your wallet address and I'll send it to you!)

## Summary

- Thank you for being in the class
- Second run through -- some rough edges, but hopefully we all learned
- Julia is a very powerful and growing language for doing computational work -- it will be worthwhile in your data careers to know it
- Topics such as graph theory, game theory, and auction theory can be applied in a wide variety of settings
- Blockchain is a perfect blend of those tools + programming + data
    - Prime example of applied "computational analysis of social complexity"
    - *If* blockchain succeeds at becoming infrastructure for future finance + web (not a given, but very possible) you will benefit from being "early"
