## Introduction

- Computational social science analyzes the connectedness of natural, social, and technological systems
- **Graph theory** (networks) has helped us understand how the *structure* of relationships influence outcomes
- We now turn to how behaviors, incentives, and strategies influence choices (and thus outcomes)
- The study of how entities make strategic choices in settings where outcomes depend on individual choices and the choices of others is called **game theory**
- Game theory is a very rich topic at the intersection of mathematics and economics
- We will study key concepts, but will not cover them in detail or exhaustively

## What is a Game?

- A game is a description of a strategic environment composed of three elements:
  1. A finite set of $N$ players
  2. For each player $i$, a set of feasible actions $S_i$
     - Define $\Sigma = \times_i S_i$ as action space  and $\sigma$ as typical element
  3. For each player $i$, a payoff function $p_i:\Sigma \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$
- To help with notation we'll focus on two player games (N=2)
- We'll also start by considering that each player has a discrete set of actions (WLOG call them $1 \dots M_i$ for player $i$)
- Basic concepts and definitions can be naturally extended to cases where $N>2$

## Example: Prisoner's Dilemma

- A very famous example of a game is called the prisoner's dilemma
- Story: two robbery suspects brought in for questioning
- Investigator immediately separates them and gives both the same deal
> If you confess and your partner doesn't, you go free and he gets 10 years. If you both confess you each get 4 years, and if neither confesses you each get 1 year.
- The payoffs for this game can be summarized as follows:

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

- Each table entry has two items 
- In terms of our definition of a game we have...
  - N = 2 players
  - Strategys: $S_i = \{\text{not confess}, \text{ confess} \}$ for both players
  - Payoffs $p_i$ as specified in the table

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

### Payoffs as matrices

- A common representation of payoffs for a single player is a matrix called the **payoff** matrix $P_i \in \mathbb{R}^{M_1 \times M_2}$ 
- The row i, column j element gives the payoff when player i chooses the $i$th action in $S_1$ and player j chooses the $j$th action in $S_2$
- For the Prisoner's Dilemma game above, we have

```{code-cell}
pd_p1 = [-1 -10; 0 -4]
pd_p2 = [-1 0 ;-10 -4]
```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

### Best Responses

- What would happen in the Prisoner's dilemma game?
- You may think that these partners in crime would like to stick together and get a total of 1 year each by not confessing
- However, that doesn't happen
- The investigator knows game theory and rigged the game against them...

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

#### What should Suspect 1 Do?

- Let's consider suspect 1

```{code-cell}
pd_p1
```

- Suppose suspect 1 believes suspect 2 will not confess
  - Suspect 1 now faces the first column of `pd_p1` and sees he's better of confessing and getting 0 years instead of -1
- What if supsect 1 believes suspect 2 will confess?
  - 1 now faces second column and prefers -4 to a -10, so he still chooses to confess
- In either case, suspect 1's **best response** is to confess
- Because confess is always a best response, we call it a dominating strategy (in this strictly dominating because it is always strictly better than not confess)

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

#### How about Suspect 2?

- If we look closely as supsect 2's payoffs we see his game is symmetric to suspect 1's:

```{code-cell}
pd_p2
```

- No matter what suspect 1 chooses, suspect 2's best response is to confess
- The rational outcome is that both players confess and spend 4 years together in prison

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

## Nash Equilibrium

- How did this happen? How is it a *rational* outcome i.e. an *equilibrium*?
- A famous concept in game theory is called Nash equilbirum (after famous economist John Nash)
- Definition: A strategy $\sigma$ is a Nash equilibrium if $\sigma_i$ is a best response to $\sigma_{-i}$ (everyone else's actions)
- Intuition: A strategy is an Nash equilibrium if *after* taking into account every one else's strategies, each player does not want to change their own

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

### Computing Nash Equilibria

- There are various algorithms that we can use for computing Nash equilibria
- Fow now we will utilize the implementation of these algorithms in the GameTheory.jl package
- Let's load it up and create a version of our prisoner's dilemma game:

```{code-cell}
# import Pkg; Pkg.add("GameTheory")
```

```{code-cell}
using GameTheory
```

```{code-cell}
p1 = Player(pd_p1)
```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

- GameTheory.jl requires that payoff matrices are always specified from the perspective of the current player
- This means that we need to "reorient" suspect 2's payoffs such that his actions are noted on the rows
- Becuase this is a symmetric game, suspect 2's payoffs from suspect 2's perspective looks exactly the same as suspect 1's payoffs from suspect 1's perspective
- We can construct our `NormalFormGame` with two copies of the `p1` player above

```{code-cell}
pd_g = NormalFormGame([p1, p1])
```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

- We can now ask GameTheory.jl to compute the nash Equilibria for us
- We'll use the `pure_nash` function to do this (we'll talk about what "pure" means soon)

```{code-cell}
pd_eq = pure_nash(pd_g)
```

- As we said before, the only equilibrium outcome to this game is that they both confess
- We can see the payoffs each player gets in equilibrium by "indexing" into the game using the strategy array
- The two expressions below are equivalent in this case

```{code-cell}
pd_g[pd_eq[1]...]
```

```{code-cell}
# ↑ Equivalent to ↓
pd_g[2, 2]
```

## Non symmetric games

- Not all games are symmetric like the prisoner's dilemma
- Consider the following game
  - Two players (firms) and two strategies each (sell low price or upscale goods)
  - 60% of total spending comes from people who prefer low prices
  - Firm 1 more popular, so when they compete in same segment, firm 1 gets 80% of market
- Below you find the payoff matrix in units of "% of total possible profit"
![https://compsosci-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/game_theory_lectures/marketing_game.png](https://compsosci-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/game_theory_lectures/marketing_game.png)

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

### Strategies

- Firm 1 has a dominant strategy: low-priced. They will always play this strategy
- Firm 2 is less clear:
  - If firm 1 were to choose the upscale market, they would be better off choosing low-priced
  - however, when firm 1 chooses low-priced, firm 2 best response is upscale
- How to find equilbirum?

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

#### Iterated Deletion of Dominated Strategies

- An algorithm that can help find the solution to this game is called *iterated deletion of dominated strategies*
- The algorithm proceeds as follows:
  - Set iteration $n = 0$
  - Let $S_i^n$ be set of remaining actions for player $i$ on iteration $n$. Start $S_i^0 = S_i$
  - On iteration $n$, for each player $i$ remove from $S_i^n$ any strategies that are dominated by other strategies in $S_i^n$ (taking into account $S_{-i}^n$). Call surviving strategies $S_i^{n+1}$
  - Repeat for all players $i$
  - Repeat until one of two conditions is met:

1. Each player has only one remaining strategy: $|S_i^{n+1}| = 1 \forall i$ -- this is NE
2. One or more players has an empty strategy set

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

#### Application to Marketing Game

- Applying this algorithm we start with $S_1^0 = \{1, 2\} \; S_2^0 = \{1, 2\}$
- We see form firm 1 it is optimal to play strategy `1` for any choice of firm 2, which causes us to delete `2`. Now we have $S_1^1 = \{1 \} \; S_2^1 = \{1, 2\}$
- Now firm 2 takes into account that 1 will play `1` -- only best response is to play `2` and we get $S_1^2 = \{1 \} \; S_2^2 = \{2\}$
- We are done!
- The unique Nash Equilibrium is for firm 1 to take the low-price segment and firm 2 to take the upscale segment

#### Exercise

- Construct the Marketing Game using GameTheory.jl
- Verify that the only pure strategy nash equilibrium is [1, 2]
- HINT: don't forget to write player 2's payoffs from player 2's perspective!

```{code-cell}
p1_market = Player([0.0 0; 0 0])
p2_market = Player([0.0 0; 0 0])
g_market = NormalFormGame([p1_market, p2_market])
```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

## Matching Pennies

- Consider the payoff matrices for another famous game called Matching Pennies 

```{code-cell}
pennies_p1 = [-1 1; 1 -1]
pennies_p2 = [1 -1; -1 1]

pennies_p1, pennies_p2
```

- Question: how many players are there?
- How many strategies does player 1 have? Player 2?

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

### More Questions

- Does player 1 have a dominating strategy?
- How about player 2?
- What is player 1's best response when 2 chooses `T`? What about when 2 chooses `H`?

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

### Pure Strategies

- Choosing a strategy outright is called playing a **pure strategy**
- Neither player will always choose `H` or `T` no matter what the other player does
- We can say that there is no Nash Equilibrium in pure strategies 
- However, for all games we will consider (and most games in general) there is always a Nash equilibrium...

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

### Mixed Strategies

- Sometimes players will not be able to play pure strategies in eqiulibrium
- In these cases they will need to *randomize* their behavior
- A **mixed strategy** is a probability distribution over strategies
- For example, in the matching pennies game, a mixed strategy is to play `H` with probabilty 0.5 and `T` with probability 0.5
- It turns out that both players playing this mixed strategy is the unique Nash Equilibrium of the matching pennies game

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

## Mixed Strategies with GameTheory.jl

- GameTheory.jl can compute mixed strategy nash equilibria for us
- To do that we'll use the `support_enumeration` method (support enumeration is the name of an algorithm for computing **all** NE of a game, in pure or mixed strategies)

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

### Bimatrix

- Before we have GameTheory compute our mixed strategy NE, we'll show one other way to create a `NormalFormGame` -- with a payoff **bimatrix**
- For an $N$ player game with $N_i$ strategies for each player, a bimatrix is an $N_1 \times N_2 \times \cdots \times N_N \times N$ array of payoffs
- For our game, we need a 2x2x2 array
  - last 2 represents 2 players
  - first two 2's represent 2 actions per player

```{code-cell}
pennies_bimatrix = zeros(2, 2, 2)
pennies_bimatrix[1, 1, :] = [-1, 1]
pennies_bimatrix[1, 2, :]  = [1, -1]
pennies_bimatrix[2, 1, :] = [1, -1]
pennies_bimatrix[2, 2, :] = [-1, 1]
pennies_g = NormalFormGame(pennies_bimatrix)
```

- Notice how when using a bimatrix we can directly read the cells of the normal form game
  - The (H,H) cell is in position [1,1] and has payoffs [-1, 1]
  - The (T, H) cell is in position [2, 1] and has payoffs [1, -1]
  - etc.
- This can make it easier to specify payoffs because we don't have to worry about "player N payoffs from player N's perspective"

```{code-cell}
support_enumeration(pennies_g)
```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

### Exercise

- Try `support_enumeration` with the other two games we've worked with
  - What does it give you with the prisoner's dilemma?
  - What does it give you with the marketing game?
