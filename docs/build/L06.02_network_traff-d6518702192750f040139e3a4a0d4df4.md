## Congestion

- We regularly use physical networks of all kinds
  - Power grids
  - The internet
  - Streets
  - Railroads
- What happens when the networks get congested?
  - Typically -- flow across the network slows down
- Today we'll study how game theoretic ideas are helpful when analyzing how a network with finite capacity or increasing costs

## A Traffic Network

- We'll start by considering a traffic network
- The figure caption has extra detail -- so be sure to read it!

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

- We'll write up some helper Julia functions that will let us create and visualize the traffic network for arbitrary values of x

```{code-cell}
using Graphs, SimpleWeightedGraphs, GraphPlot, Interact
```

```{code-cell}
function traffic_graph1(x)
    A = [
        0 0 x/100 45;
        0 0 0 0;
        0 45 0 0;
        0 x/100 0 0
        ]
    SimpleWeightedDiGraph(A)
end
```

```{code-cell}
function plot_traffic_graph(g::SimpleWeightedDiGraph)
    locs_x = [1.0, 3, 2, 2]
    locs_y = [1.0, 1, 0, 2]
    labels = collect('A':'Z')[1:nv(g)]
    gplot(g, locs_x, locs_y, nodelabel=labels, edgelabel=weight.(edges(g)))
end
```

```{code-cell}
@manipulate for x=10:10:4000
    plot_traffic_graph(traffic_graph1(x))
end
```

### The Game

- Now suppose, as indicated in the figure caption, that we have 4,000 drivers that need to commute from A to B in the morning
- If all take the upper route (A-C-B) we get a total time of 40 + 45 = 85 minutes
- If all take the lower route (A-D-B) we get a total time of 40 + 45 = 85 minutes
- If, however, they evenly divide we get a total time of 20 + 45 = 65 minutes


+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

### Equilibrium

- Recall that for a set of strategies (here driving paths) to be a Nash Equilibrium, each player's strategy must be a best response to the strategy of all other players
- We'll argue that the only NE of this commuting game is that 2,000 drivers take (A-C-B) and 2,000 take (A-D-B) and everyone takes 65 mintues to commute


+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

### Exercise

- Show that this strategy (2,000 drivers take (A-C-B) and 2,000 take (A-D-B)) is indeed a Nash equilibrium
- To do this recognize that the game is symmetric for all drivers
- Then, argue that if 3,999 drivers are following that strategy, the best response for the last driver is also to follow the strategy

### Discussion

- Note a powerful outcome here -- without any coordination by a central authority, drivers  will automatically balance perfectly in equilibrium
- The only assumptions we made were:
  1. Drivers want to minimize driving time
  2. Drivers are allowed to respond to the decisions of others
- The first assumption is very plausable -- nobody wants to sit in more traffic than necessary
- The second highlights a key facet of our modern society...
  - Information availability (here decisions of other drivers) can (and does!) lead to optimal outcomes without the need for further regulation or policing

## Adding a "warp tunnel"

- Now suppose that we modify the network and add a new edge between C-D that has **zero cost**
- Effectively we add a wormhole that connects C to D

```{code-cell}
function traffic_graph2(x)
    G = traffic_graph1(x)
    # need to add an edge with minimal weight so it shows up in plot
    add_edge!(G, 3, 4, 1e-16)
    G
end
```

```{code-cell}
@manipulate for x2=10:10:4000
    plot_traffic_graph(traffic_graph2(x2))
end
```

### Exercise

- Is a 50/50 split of traffic still a Nash equilibrium in this case?
- Why or why not?
- Is all 4,000 drivers doing (A-C-D-B) a Nash equilibrium?
- Why or why not?

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

### Braes' Paradox

- In the previous exercise, we saw a rather startling result...
- Doing a network "upgrade" -- adding a wormhole connecting C and D -- resulted in a *worse* equilibrium outcome for everyone!
- The equilbirum driving time is now 80 mintues for all drivers instead of 65 minutes (which was the case before the wormhole)
- This is known as Braes' paradox

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

### Follow ups

- Braes' paradox was the starting point for a large body of research on using game theory to analyze network traffic
- Some questions that have been asked are:
  - How much larger can equilibirum travel time increase after a network upgrade?
  - How can network upgrade be designed to be resilient to Braes' paradox?

## Social Welfare

- Many economic models are composed of individual actors who make autonomous decisions and have autonomous payoffs
- We've been studying some of these settings using tools from game theory, focusing on the *individual* perspective
  - Our notion of equilibrium is dependent on no individual wanting to change strategy in response to other strategies
- Another form of analysis works at the macro level -- we analyze the **total** payoff for all agents (i.e. sum of payoffs)
- We call this aggregate payoff **social welfare**

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

### The Social Planner

- In an economic model, someone who seeks to maximize social welfare is called a *social planner*
- A social planner is given the authority to make decisions for all agents
- In our traffic model, a social planner would choose to ignore the wormhole and have 1/2 the drivers take A-C-B and the other half take A-D-B
  - In this case everyone would be better off with a cost of 65 minutes instead of the equilibrium 80 minutes

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

### Cost of Freedom

- Question: in a generic traffic model, how much *worse* can the equilibrium outcome be than the social optimium?
- In our example, 
  - Optimal social welfare is 4000 * 65 = $(4000*65)
  - Equilibrium social welfare is 4000 * 80 = $(4000*80)
  - A change of $(4000*15)
- To answer this question for a general traffic model, we need to be able to compute the equilibrium for a generic traffic model
- We may study this next week, or perhaps even on your homework ðŸ˜‰
