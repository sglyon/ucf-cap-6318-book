## Step 1: Install Julia

- The first step is to install Julia

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

### Task: Install Julia

Download and install Julia, from [download page](http://julialang.org/downloads/) , accepting all default options

+++

### Task: Launch Julia REPl

Launch the Julia REPL (read-eval-print-loop) by clicking on the Julia icon

You will be greated with a prompt that looks like this:

```
               _
   _       _ _(_)_     |  Documentation: https://docs.julialang.org
  (_)     | (_) (_)    |
   _ _   _| |_  __ _   |  Type "?" for help, "]?" for Pkg help.
  | | | | | | |/ _` |  |
  | | |_| | | | (_| |  |  Version 1.9.2 (2023-07-05)
 _/ |\__'_|_|_|\__'_|  |  Official https://julialang.org/ release
|__/                   |

julia>
```

You are now in what is called the Julia REPL (read-eval-print-loop). This is a place where you can type Julia commands and have them executed immediately.

Test it out by typing `rand(2, 2)` and pressing enter

You should see something like this (note the numbers will be different for you):

```
julia> rand(2, 2)
2Ã—2 Matrix{Float64}:
 0.698944  0.676245
 0.17375   0.448243
 ```

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Julia and are ready to move on to the next step!

## Step 2: Install IJulia.jl

- With Julia installed we are now ready to install some Julia packages
- The first package we'll be using is called IJulia
- This is a package integrates with Jupyter to allow us to run Julia code from notebooks
    - Same Jupyter you may have used with Python

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

### Task: Install IJulia

Launch the Julia REPL (by typing `julia` from the Linux/OSX terminal prompt or using the start menu on Windows)

At the `juila>` prompt, type `]`

Prompt will switch to `(@v1.8) pkg> `

Once there type `add IJulia` and press enter

IJulia.jl will be downloaded and installed on your machine

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

### Task: Start IJulia

At the `juila>` prompt (press backspace to exit Pkg mode if needed), type `using IJulia`

Then run the command: `IJulia.notebook()`

A web browser should pop open with the IJulia.jl interface (should look similar to what I'm using)

+++

## Step 3: Install Visual Studio Code

- While we can and will use the native Julia REPL and first-party Jupyter software for our lecture notes, it is also helpful to have the ability to edit and run Julia code in a more full-featured editor
- For this we will use Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
- VSCode is a free, open-source, cross-platform editor that has a large community of users and developers
- It also has great support for Julia
- Learning how to use a general purpose text editor will help you in the long run
    - You can use it for Julia, Python, R, C, C++, etc.
    - You can use it for writing papers, taking notes, etc.

+++

### Task: Download/Install VS Code

Download and install VSCode from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Follow all system prompts and accept default options

Open/launch VSCode


+++

### Task: Install Julia extension

- VSCode has a large ecosystem of extensions that add functionality to the editor
- We will install the Julia extension to add Julia support to VSCode

In VSCode, click on the "Extensions" icon in the left-hand toolbar (looks like a box with four squares in it)

Search for "Julia" and click the "Install" button on the "Julia Language Support" extension

+++

### Task: run Julia code in VSCode

- We can now run Julia code in VSCode
- Open a new file in VSCode (File -> New File)
- Type the following code into the file:

```julia
println("Hello world!")
```

- Save the file as `hello.jl` in a location you can find later
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (or `Cmd + Shift + P` on Mac) to open the command palette
- Type "Julia" and select "Julia: Run file in new process"
- You should see the output of the code show up in a new terminal window within VS Code

+++

### Task: run code with shift + Enter

Go back to `hello.jl` and add the code

```julia
n = 5
P = rand(n, n)
```

Then, put your cursor on the line that contains `n =` and press shift and enter at the same time

This will start a new Julia REPL within your VS Code session and execute the code for you

It will also move your cursor down to the `P =` line. Press shift + enter again to execute that line

## Open Notebooks Locally

- You should view/follow along with lectures on the your computer
- Being able to run code on your machine is critical for success in this course and will allow you to take skills with you after the course

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

### Task: Download notebooks

- Go to Canvas and download the notebooks for the first week
- Move the downloaded folder from your "Downloads" folder to wherever you'd like to store materials for the semester
- Follow the instructions above to start Julia, load IJulia, and open the Jupyter notebook with IJulia
- Inside your local Jupyter notebook instance (in your web browser), navigate to where you copied the "Handouts" folder and open up this notebook

+++

### Task: Open notebook in vscode

- You can also run Jupyter notebooks directly in VS Code
- Open VS Code and click on the "File" menu and select "Open Folder"
- Navigate to where you copied the "Handouts" folder and open it
- Click on the "Handouts" folder in the left-hand toolbar
- Click on the "L02_02_setup.ipynb" file in the left-hand toolbar
- You should see the notebook open in VS Code
- You can run cells by clicking the "Run Cell" button in the top right of each cell, or by pressing `Shift + Enter` while your cursor is in the cell
    - A menu will appear, choose the option containing `Julia Release`
- Test this out below

```{code-cell}
# some random Julia code
println("That's all, folks!")
```
