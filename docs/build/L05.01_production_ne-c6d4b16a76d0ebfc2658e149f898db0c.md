## Linear Algebra

- Linear algebra is the backbone of modern computational algorithms
    - Graphics
    - Statistics
    - Data analysis
    - Optimization
    - Machine Learning
- Workhorse for accelerated computing
  - GPUs work on matrices to efficiently parallellize common computations
  - Specialty hardware like the TPU (tensor processing unit) take this even further

### Building Blocks

- Vectors: arrays of numbers representing pionts in multi-dimensional space
- Matrices
    - Rectangular arrays that transform vectors
    - Also used to represent certain datasets/relationships: e.g. adjacency matrix in Graph Theory
- Tensors: higher dimensional collections of numbers that allow high-dimensional
    - Vectors are 1d tensors, matrices 2d tensors, etc.
    - Implemented in numpy as `np.array`

### Some Key Theories

1. Linear systems of equations
2. Inner product spaces (length, distance, and angles)
3. Eigenvalues and eigen vectors (spectral theory)

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": ""}}

### Spectral Theory

- Let's dig into eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$
- A scalar $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$ is an **eigenvalue** of $A$ if there exists a nonzero vector $e \in \mathbb{C}^n$ such that $A e = \lambda e$
- A vector $e$ satisfying this equality is called an **eigenvector** corresponding to the eigenvalue $\lambda$
- A vector $\epsilon$ sastifying $A ' \epsilon = \lambda \epsilon$ is a **left-eigenvector** of $A$

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": ""}}

#### Definitions

- The set of all eigenvalues of $A$ is called the **spectrum** of $A$ and is written $\sigma(A)$
- The **spectral radius** of $A$ is written $r(A) \equiv \max \{ | \lambda | : \lambda \in \sigma(A) \}$
    - The spectral radius important when considering the convergence of a dynamic system driven by $A$
    - If $x_{t+1} = A x_t$ and $r(A)< 1$ then the sequence $\{x\}_t$ is finite and will converge
- Some facts (not proven here)
    - $A$ will have *at most* $n$ distinct eigenvalues
    - Eigenvectors are only unique to a scalar multiple: if $(\lambda, e)$ is an eigenpair, then so is $(\lambda, \alpha e)$ for any $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}, \alpha \ne 0$
- Sometimes a matrix will have a repeated eigenvalue (the same value works with multiple distinct
- The **algebraic multiplicity** of an eigenvalue is the number of times it is repeated with distinct eigenvectors
- An eigenvalue with an algebraic multiplicity of one is called **simple**

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": ""}}

#### Diagonalization

- A matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is diagonalizable if $A = PDP^{-1}$
    - $D = \text{diag}(\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_n)$, $P$ is some invertible matrix
- The decomposition is called the **eigen decomposition** or **spectral decomposition** of $A$
- The asymptotic properties of $m \mapsto A^m$ are determined by $\sigma(A)$
    - Can be seen when $A$ is diagonalizable
    - If $A = P \text{diag}(\lambda) P^{-1} \Longrightarrow A^m = P \text{diag}(\lambda_i^m) P^{-1}$

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": ""}}

### Example: Worker Dynamics

- Consider a continuum of workers (large number, not counted discretely)
- Workers can be in one of two states: (1) employed and (2) unemployed
- Each month workers are hired at a rate $\alpha$ and fired at a rate $\beta$
- We express these dynamics as a Graph with adjacency matrix:

$$P_w = \begin{bmatrix}1-\alpha & \alpha \\ \beta & 1-\beta \end{bmatrix} \; \alpha, \beta \in [0, 1]$$

- Row $1$ gives the probabilities of employment and unemployement for an employed worker
- Row $2$ gives the probabilities of employment and unemployement for an unemployed worker

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": ""}}

#### Transitions

- Suppose we have a vector $x \in [0, 1]^2$ representing current fraction of workers thare are employed and unemployed
- Question... What matrix operation between $P_w$ and $x$ will give the fraction of workers that start next month as employed and unemployed?

### Neumann Series Lemma

- We need one more linear alegbra result...
- If $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ and $r(A) < 1$, then $I-A$ is non-singular and $$(I-A)^{-1} = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} A^m$$
- This is known as the Neumann series lemma

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": ""}}

## Production Networks

- We will now study a family of economic models that allow us to analyze the economy as a collection of sectors
- These models were proposed by nobel prize winner Wassily Leontief in 1941 and are still commonly used today
- The key idea behind a Leontief model is the input-output table

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": ""}}

### Input-output tables

- Firms (companies) are categorized into $n$ distinct sectors
- Firms use materials produced by other sectors as part of their production process
- The relationship of flows of *value* are organized into an input/output table

| | sector 1 | sector 2 | sector 3|
|-| -------- | -------- | ------- | 
| sector 1 | $a_{11}$ | $a_{12}$ | $a_{13}$ |
| sector 2 | $a_{21}$ | $a_{22}$ | $a_{23}$ |
| sector 3 | $a_{31}$ | $a_{32}$ | $a_{33}$ |

- $a_{ij}$ is called an **input-output coefficient** and is equal to:

$$a_{ij} = \frac{\text{value of sector j inputs purchased from sector i}}{\text{total sales of sector j}}$$

- If $a_{ij}$ is large, sector $i$ is an important **supplier** of intermediate goods to sector $j$
- The sum of column $j$ is the value of all inputs to sector $j$
- Row $i$ shows how intensively each sector uses good $i$ as an intermediate good
- The input output table can be directly used as the adjacency matrix for a weighted directed graph

+++ {"editable": true, "slideshow": {"slide_type": ""}}

### Input-output data

- In the United States, the Bureau of Economic Analysis is responsible for compiling input-output tables for sectors
- We'll be studying the [Input-Output Accounts Data](https://www.bea.gov/industry/input-output-accounts-data)
- The main set of tables we'll be using are called the `Make-Use` tables
- The `Make` table shows the value of final goods produced by each sector
    - Note this is predominately a diagonal matrix as each sector primarily produces and sells final goods within their sector
    - Sometimes a firm will have secondary outputs as part of their production process
    - "Which industries produce which commodities?"
- The `Use` tables show the intermediate and final use of commodities across sectors
    - "Who uses or consumes the commodities produced?"

### Example: US 15 sector data

![Input-Output Graph](https://compsosci-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/graph-theory-lectures/images/QE-networks/15-sector-graph.png)

- Color of nodes is according to their hub-based eigenvector centrality (see below)
- Size of nodes is according to their total outputs (make table)
- Thickness of edges is according to amount of goods
- Represent $a_{ij}$ and point from sector creating the intermediate good (sector $i$) to sector  using intermediate good (sector $j$)

#### Eigenvector Centrality

- The node size above shows the hub-based eigenvector centrality
- This is equal to the dominant eigenvector of the adjacency matrix (eigenvector associated with largest eigenvalue)
- This measure of centrality measures the influence of a node in a network
    - When computing this statistic for a node `N`, the value will be higher if it is connected to other "influential" nodes

### Accounting

- Let...
    - $d_i$ be the final consumer demand for good $i$
    - $x_i$ be total sales of sector $i$
    - $z_{ij}$ be inter-industry sales from sector $i$ to sector $j$
- For accounts to add up we must have $$x_i = \sum_{i=1}^n z_{ij} + d_i$$
- Notice that $$\frac{z_{ij}}{z_j} = a_{ij} = \text{dollar value of inputs from $i$ per dollar output from $j$}$$
- This means $$x_i = \sum_{j=1} a_{ij} x_j + d_i$$
- Which can be written $x = Ax + d$

+++

### Equilibrium

- An equilibrium in a Leonteif model with input-output coefficient matrix $A$ and a vector $d \in \mathbb{R}^n$ of final consumer demands for each sector is a vector $x$ for sector-specific output such that $x = Ax + d$ is satisfied
    - Note that $d$ and $A$ are treated as given
- To find this vector requires that we trace the impact of final demand on the intermediate linkages through $A$
- Example:

![Simple production network](https://compsosci-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/graph-theory-lectures/images/QE-networks/simple-production-network.png)

- Example
    - Suppose $d_3 \uparrow$
    - Will cause $3$ to consume more from its suppliers ($2$ and $4$)
    - Which will cause 2 to demand more from $1$
    - Which will cause $1$ to demand more from $2$ and $4$
    - ... and so on
- Computing an equilibrium is not entirely straight forward...

+++

### Computing an Equilibrium

- Define $v_j \equiv x_j - \sum_{i=1}^n z_{ij}$ as the value added by sector $j$
- **Assumption**: The input-output adjacency matrix $A$ satisfies $$\eta_{ij} \equiv \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ij} < 1 \; \forall j \in [n]$$
    - This holds whenever $v_j > 0 \forall j$
- When this assumption holds, for each $d \ge 0$ there is a unique, nonnegative output solution given by $$x^* = Ld \qquad \text{where } L \equiv (I-A)^{-1}$$
- The matrix $L$ is called the Leontief inverse associated with the coefficient matrix $A$

```{code-cell}
L15 = inv(I - data15.A)

# propose a demand vector where each element is between [100, 600]
d = rand(15).* 500 .+ 100

L15 * d
```

**Question**

We don't have a field for `d` in our `SectorData` struct.

How could we compute/derive `d` given the fields we do have?

```{code-cell}
fieldnames(SectorData)
```

### Demand Shocks

- A common form of economic analysis is to consider the impact of external "shocks"
- Often, these are modeled as a one time change in the value of a variable
- Let's consider a demand shock of size $\Delta d$ such that demand moves from $d_0$ to $d_1 = \Delta d + d_0$
- The equilibrium vector shifts from $x_0 = L d_0$ to $x_1 = L d_1$
- Define $\Delta x = L (d_1 - d_0) = L \delta d$

+++

### NSL

- We will further assume that $r(A)<1$ so that we can write the expression for $\Delta x$ as an infinite sum using the Neumann Series Lemma: $$\Delta x = \Delta d + A (\Delta d) + A^2 (\Delta d) + \cdots$$
    1. $\Delta d$ is the initial response in each sector,
    2. $A (\Delta d)$ is the response generated by the first round of backward linkages,
    3. $A^2 (\Delta d)$ is the response generated by the second round, and so on.
- The total response is the sum of the responses at each round
- The typical element $l_{ij}$ of $L = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} A^m$ shows total impact on sector *i* of a unit change in the demand for good $j$
