      "**Hypothesis**: Weak ties are disproportionately responsible for transmitting novel information across network clusters, so individuals who strategically maintain bridges to distant social groups adopt innovations 2-3x faster than those embedded in tight-knit communities—but this advantage disappears for information requiring deep trust or behavioral change.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Testable prediction**: Track adoption timing of a new workplace tool across employees with varying weak-tie density; we'd expect early adopters to have significantly more connections outside their immediate department, while late adopters (6+ months later) show no correlation with tie diversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Critic]\n",
      "**Strengths**: You're threading together network theory elegantly—the caveat about trust-dependent information is sophisticated and prevents oversimplification.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Critical weaknesses**:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Confounding variables undermine causality**: Early adopters likely differ in tech-savviness, organizational rank, or role requirements independent of network position. You need to measure/control for these or use randomization (e.g., assign adoption timing exogenously). Without it, you can't separate \"bridge-spanning predicts adoption\" from \"tech-forward people naturally build bridges.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **The prediction is too loose**: \"Significantly more connections\" is vague—what's the effect size, and how will you distinguish signal from noise? More critically, the claim that *late adopters show no correlation* is hard to falsify; weak correlations could reflect statistical power rather than a true threshold effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Missing mechanism**: Why does tie diversity *stop* mattering for behavioral change? Is it because trust becomes rate-limiting, or because bridging ties are actually worse for complex adoption (high uncertainty = defer to trusted in-group)? Test this directly rather than inferring from disappearing correlation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sharper test**: Stratify by adoption complexity (tool-use-only vs. workflow-redesign) *a priori*, measure homophily + tie strength + personal innovativeness as competing predictors, and report standardized effects to show which dominates when.\n",
      "\n",
      "------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "[Researcher]\n",
      "You've identified the critical gap: I conflated correlation with causation. Here's a tighter hypothesis:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Revised hypothesis**: Weak ties accelerate adoption of *low-complexity* information (tool awareness) specifically because they bypass in-group conformity pressure, but for high-complexity adoption (workflow redesign), strong ties within one's role-peer group predict speed better than network bridges—because peers share tacit knowledge of implementation barriers that weak ties cannot transmit.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Testable design**: Within a single organization, randomize *timing* of tool announcement (some teams learn via weak-tie bridges from early-adopter departments, others via their strong-tie peer networks only), measure adoption by task complexity tier, and report standardized coefficients for tie strength × complexity interaction. Crucially, pre-measure tech-savviness and rank to include as controls, then report whether weak-tie effects survive when these are held constant.\n",
      "\n",
      "This avoids your three critiques: (1) randomization breaks confounding, (2) specifies complexity as the moderator so the prediction is falsifiable—if no interaction emerges, the hypothesis fails cleanly, and (3) the mechanism is explicit (conformity vs. tacit knowledge) rather than inferred from disappearing correlations.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Critic]\n",
      "**Excellent tightening**—you've converted a soft correlational claim into a falsifiable interaction effect with clear boundary conditions. Randomizing *timing* is clever and much stronger than observational designs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Remaining concerns**:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Randomization validity**: Can you truly randomize announcement routing, or will information leak across your experimental partition? Employees talk across departments; weak-tie bridges may activate *despite* your manipulation. Consider measuring actual information exposure post-hoc (did teams really stay isolated?) rather than trusting the randomization worked.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Interaction detection is statistically hungry**: Detecting a tie-strength × complexity interaction reliably requires large N and strong effect sizes. If effects are modest (realistic for organizational adoption), you may lack power. Pre-register sample size and alpha; consider whether a simpler design (comparing two complexity tiers with stratified analysis) is more robust than testing a full interaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **\"Tacit knowledge\" mechanism remains fuzzy**: You've named it, but how will you know that's what's actually driving the strong-tie effect for complex adoption? Measure it: ask adopters post-hoc whether they consulted peers for implementation barriers, and whether that consultation predicted speed. Otherwise \"tacit knowledge\" is just a label for unexplained residual variance.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Strongest next step**: Pilot with 2–3 teams to confirm (a) randomization holds, (b) you can reliably measure complexity-tier adoption, and (c) post-hoc surveys on consultation patterns actually discriminate your mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "[Researcher]\n",
      "**Incorporated—here's the pre-piloted version**:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Revised design**: Pilot with 3 teams (N~60) to validate (1) information containment via staggered announcements + post-hoc exposure surveys asking \"how did you first learn about this tool?\" to catch leakage, and (2) reliable complexity-tier measurement by pre-classifying tasks and measuring adoption separately per tier. If randomization holds and tiers show differential adoption rates, proceed to the full study stratified by *measured* exposure (not assignment), controlling for actual information route.\n",
      "\n",
      "**On mechanism**: Post-adoption, ask all adopters: \"Did you consult colleagues on *how* to integrate this into your workflow, and if so, how much did their barriers/workarounds influence your own adoption speed?\" Segment by tie type (strong in-group vs. weak cross-group) and run mediation analysis: does consultation frequency + barrier-sharing explain the strong-tie advantage for complex tasks? If not, the mechanism isn't tacit knowledge—it's something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Falsifiable**, because if the pilot shows (a) info leaks too much to randomize cleanly, abandon the design; (b) complexity-tier adoption rates don't differ, the boundary condition is wrong; or (c) post-hoc consultation doesn't mediate the strong-tie effect for complex adoption, the mechanism is misspecified and needs reconceptualization.\n",
      "\n",
      "This trades elegance for epistemic honesty—we're building iteratively rather than assuming a large clean trial will work.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Critic]\n",
      "**This is methodologically mature**—you're frontloading failure modes rather than hoping they vanish at scale, and the mediation approach directly tests mechanism rather than inferring it. That's rare.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Final pressure tests**:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Mediation logic**: If adoption speed is your outcome, consultation frequency is the mediator, and tie type is the predictor, you need to establish that tie type → consultation → speed (not just that consultation correlates with speed). The direction matters; weak ties might predict *slower* adoption precisely *because* people consult fewer colleagues. Specify directionality in your mediation model and collect timeline data (adoption date vs. consultation date) to defend causality claims.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Post-hoc measurement risks**: Self-reported \"how much did barriers influence you?\" is vulnerable to rationalization and recall bias—people adopt, then construct narratives about why. Consider objective proxies instead: track *actual consultation patterns* via chat logs or meeting data (if available), or ask people to identify specific workarounds *before* adoption, then measure overlap with adopted workflows.
