# Structural Balance

**Prerequisites**

- Introduction to Graphs
- Strong and Weak Ties
- Weighted Graphs

**Outcomes**

- Understand the structural balance property for sets of three nodes
- Understand the structural balance theorem for a graph
- Recognize structural balance in a weighted graph

**References**

- [Easley and Kleinberg](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/) chapter 5 (especially section 5.1-5-3)

## Introduction

- We now shift our discussion to the notion of whether or not a network is balanced
- For this discussion we will use weighted graphs, where weights are one of
  - 1: if nodes are friends (also called `+`)
  - 0: if they don't know eachother
  - -1: if nodes are enemies (also called `-`)
- We won't consider strength of ties right now
- We will also limit discussion to complete graphs (cliques) where all nodes are connected to all other nodes

## Balance in Triangles

- To start thinking about balance, consider the possible configurations of `+` and `-` edges in a triangle
- There are 4 options as shown below

- In (a) all people are friends -- this is happy and balanced
- In (c) A-B are friends with a common enemy C -- nobody has reason to change alliances => balanced
- In (b) A is friends with B and C, but they are enemies -- B and C may try to flip A against other => not balanced
- In (d) all are enemies -- two parties have incentive to team up against common enemy => not balanced

## Balance In Graphs

- This definition of balance in triangles can be extended to graphs
- A complete graph G satisfies the **Structural Balance Property** if for *every* set of three nodes, exactly one or three of the edges is labeled `+`

### Implications: Balance Theorem

- One implication of the Structural Balance Property is the **Balance Theorem**
> If a labeled complete graph is balanced, then either all pairs of nodes are friends, or else the nodes can be divided into two groups, X and Y , such that every pair of nodes in X like each other, every pair of nodes in Y like each other, and everyone in X is the enemy of everyone in Y .
- Notice the strength of the statement: either all `+` or two mutually exclusive groups of friends that are all enemies with other group

### Proving Balance Theorem

- We will provide some intuition for how to prove the Balance Theorem, which will help us understand why it is true
- Consider a complete Graph `G`
- Two alternative cases:
  1. Everyone is friends: satisfies theorem by definition
  2. There are some `+` and some `-` edges: need to prove
- For case 2, we must be able to split G into $X$ and $Y$ where the following hold
  1. Every node in $X$ is friends with every other node in $X$
  2. Every node in $Y$ is friends with every other node in $Y$
  3. Every node in $X$ is enemies with every node in $Y$

### Proof by construction

- Start with complete, balanced graph $G$ (our only assumption!)
- We will prove the balance theorem by constructing sets $X$ and $Y$ and verifying that the members of these sets satisfy the 3 properties outlined above
- To start, pick any node $A \in G$
- Divide all other nodes that are friends with $A$ into $X$ and enemies into $Y$
- Because $G$ is complete, this is all nodes

#### Condition 1: $\forall B, C \in X \quad B \rightarrow C = +$

- Let $B, C \in X$
- We know $A \rightarrow B = +$ and $A \rightarrow C = +$
- Because graph is balanced, this triangle must have 1 or 3 +
- There are already 2, so it must be that $B \rightarrow C = +$
- B, C were arbitrary, so this part is proven

#### Condition 2: $\forall D, E \in Y \quad D \rightarrow E = +$

- Let $D, E \in Y$
- We know $A \rightarrow D = -$ and $A \rightarrow E = -$
- Because graph is balanced, this triangle must have 1 or 3 +
- There no + and only one option left, so it must be that $D \rightarrow E = +$
- D, E were arbitrary, so this part is proven

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

#### Condition 3: $\forall B \in X$ and $E \in Y \quad B \rightarrow E = -$

- Let $B \in X$ and $D \in Y$
- We know $A \rightarrow D = -$ and $A \rightarrow B = +$
- Because graph is balanced, this triangle must have 1 or 3 +
- There is one + ($A \rightarrow B$) and only one option left, so it must be that $B \rightarrow D = -$
- B, D were arbitrary, so this part is proven

### Summary

- We've just proven that for any complete, balanced graph $G$; we can partition $G$ into sets $X$ and $Y$ that satisfy the group structure of all friends or two groups of friends
- This has interesting implications for fields like social interactions, international relations, and online behavior

## Application: International Relations

- Consider the evolution of alliances in Europe between 1872 and 1907 as represented in the graphs below
