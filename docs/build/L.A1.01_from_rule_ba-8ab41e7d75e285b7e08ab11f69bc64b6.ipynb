    "- We've spent two weeks studying agent-based models\n",
    "- Remember the Schelling segregation model?\n",
    "  - Agents with simple rules: \"move if less than N neighbors are like me\"\n",
    "  - Environment: 25x25 grid\n",
    "  - Result: stark segregation patterns emerge from mild preferences\n",
    "- Those were **rule-based agents** - they follow explicit, programmed instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let me show you something different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose I asked you to write an agent that could:\n",
    "- Analyze a news article and summarize it\n",
    "- Answer questions about complex topics it's never seen before\n",
    "- Generate creative stories in the style of different authors\n",
    "- Write code to solve novel problems\n",

    "\n",
    "**Rule-Based Approach (Traditional ABMs)**:\n",
    "- Developer writes explicit rules\n",
    "- Agent follows those rules deterministically (or with simple randomness)\n",
    "- Behavior is predictable from the code\n",
    "- Example: `if unhappy then move to random location`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Approach (Modern AI)**:\n",
    "- Developer provides training data and objectives\n",
    "- System learns patterns and relationships\n",
    "- Behavior emerges from learned representations\n",
    "- Example: \"Here are 10 trillion words from the internet - learn to predict what comes next\"\n",

    "## Connecting to What We Know\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into AI agents, let's think about what made our ABMs interesting:\n",
    "\n",
    "**In the Schelling Model**:\n",
    "1. Simple agent logic (check neighbors, decide to move)\n",
    "2. Local information only (can't see whole grid)\n",
    "3. Emergent behavior (segregation without a segregationist)\n",
    "4. Aggregate outcomes differ from individual intentions\n",
    "\n",
    "**In the Money Model**:\n",
    "1. Even simpler logic (give $1 to random agent)\n",
    "2. No intelligence at all, just random exchanges\n",
    "3. Power law wealth distribution emerges\n",
    "4. Inequality arises from equality plus randomness\n",
    "\n",
    "These models taught us that **complexity can emerge from simplicity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider this: what if we could build agents that aren't simple?\n",
    "\n",
    "What if individual agents could:\n",
    "- Reason about their situation\n",
    "- Learn from experience\n",
    "- Communicate in natural language\n",
    "- Adapt their strategies\n",
    "- Form and revise beliefs\n",
    "\n",
    "What kinds of collective behaviors might emerge then?\n",

    "### What is an LLM?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Large Language Model is a neural network trained to predict the next word (or \"token\") in a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it. Really.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this simple objective, when applied at massive scale, produces something remarkable: a general-purpose reasoning engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Training Process**:\n",
    "1. Collect enormous amounts of text (books, websites, code, papers, conversations)\n",
    "2. For each sequence, hide the next word and ask the model to predict it\n",
    "3. Adjust the model's parameters (billions of them) to improve predictions\n",
    "4. Repeat trillions of times\n",
    "\n",
    "**What the Model Learns**:\n",
    "- Grammar and syntax (obvious)\n",
    "- Facts about the world (it saw them in training data)\n",
    "- Reasoning patterns (it saw examples of reasoning)\n",
    "- Causal relationships (they're implicit in language)\n",
    "- Social norms and conventions (they're encoded in how people write)\n",
    "- Task structures (it saw many examples of questions and answers)\n",
    "\n",
    "### From Next-Word Prediction to Intelligence\n",
    "\n",
    "You might think: \"How does predicting the next word lead to intelligence?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"The doctor told the patient that she would need to come back next week. The patient thanked...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "To predict the next word, the model needs to:\n",
    "- Track that \"she\" refers to \"the patient\"\n",
    "- Understand doctor-patient relationships\n",
    "- Know social conventions about gratitude\n",
    "- Predict \"her\" (the doctor) is the likely continuation\n",
    "\n",
    "Or this one:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"If all mammals have hearts, and whales are mammals, then whales...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this, the model must:\n",
    "- Recognize a logical argument structure\n",
    "- Apply deductive reasoning\n",
    "- Predict \"have hearts\" or similar\n",
    "\n",
    "**The key insight**: To predict text well, you need to model the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text is the trace of human thought, and to predict it accurately, you need to simulate the thinking that produced it."

    "### Transformer Architecture (High-Level Intuition)\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't dive deep into the math, but here's the essential idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Challenge**: When predicting the next word, which previous words matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "In \"The doctor told the patient that she would need to come back\", the word \"doctor\" is relevant for predicting what comes after \"the patient thanked\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution: Attention Mechanism**\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformer architecture uses \"attention\" to let each word look at all previous words and decide which ones are relevant:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"The patient thanked\" <-- looks back at entire sequence\n",
    "                       <-- pays attention to \"doctor\" (high weight)\n",
    "                       <-- pays less attention to \"told\" (medium weight)\n",
    "                       <-- ignores \"the\" (low weight)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This attention mechanism is:\n",
    "- Learned, not programmed (the model figures out what to attend to)\n",
    "- Parallel (can process all words simultaneously)\n",
    "- Multi-headed (multiple attention patterns can operate in parallel)\n",
    "- Stackable (many layers of attention build complex representations)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Network Analogy**:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you squint, attention looks like a weighted graph where:\n",
    "- Nodes are words/tokens\n",
    "- Edges are attention weights\n",
    "- Information flows along high-weight edges\n",

    "The model learns to construct this graph dynamically based on the input!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scale is All You Need (Almost)\n",
    "\n",
    "A remarkable empirical finding: model capabilities scale predictably with:\n",
    "1. **Model size** (number of parameters)\n",
    "2. **Data size** (amount of training text)\n",
    "3. **Compute** (training time × hardware)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scaling Laws** show that doubling compute roughly gives consistent improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern LLMs (as of 2025):\n",

    "### A New Interface for Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "With traditional programming:\n",
    "- You write explicit instructions in a formal language (Julia, Python, etc.)\n",
    "- The computer executes them precisely\n",
    "- You get exactly what you specified (bugs included)\n",
    "\n",

    "- The model interprets your intent\n",

    "This is **prompting** - the art and science of instructing LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anatomy of a Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "A good prompt typically includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Role/Context**: Who should the model be?\n",
    "   - \"You are an expert economist...\"\n",
    "   - \"You are a helpful teaching assistant...\"\n",

    "2. **Task**: What should it do?\n",
    "   - \"Analyze the following dataset...\"\n",

    "3. **Constraints**: How should it do it?\n",

    "   - \"Respond in JSON format\"\n",
    "   - \"Keep your answer under 100 words\"\n",

    "4. **Examples** (optional): Show, don't just tell\n",
    "   - Few-shot learning: provide input-output examples\n",
    "   - The model learns the pattern and applies it\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Output Format**: Structure the response\n",
    "   - \"Provide your answer as a numbered list\"\n",
    "   - \"Format your response as: Analysis: ... Conclusion: ...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### In-Context Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most striking capabilities of LLMs is **in-context learning**:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can teach the model a new task just by showing it examples in the prompt - no retraining needed!\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Translate English to Pig Latin:\n",
    "\n",
    "English: hello\n",
    "Pig Latin: ellohay\n",
    "\n",
    "English: world  \n",
    "Pig Latin: orldway\n",
    "\n",
    "English: agent\n",
    "Pig Latin:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The model will likely output: `agentyay` or `agentay`\n",
    "\n",
    "It learned the pattern from just two examples!\n",

    "   - **GPT-5-mini** - Cost-effective, 5x cheaper than GPT-5\n",
    "   - **o3** and **o3-mini** - Specialized reasoning models\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Note**: We use OpenAI's modern Responses API (`/v1/responses`) which provides a cleaner interface with separate `instructions` and `input` parameters. This is recommended for new projects. See the [Responses API Quickstart](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?api-mode=responses) for more details.\n",

Each person has a preference for living near others like themselves—for example, they're content only if at least a certain percentage of their neighbors are the same group. Even though each person's preference for same-group neighbors is relatively mild, the model shows that the entire neighborhood becomes highly segregated over time, with groups clustering into separate areas.\n"

      "- Players: the decision-makers in the situation.\n",
      "- Strategies: the possible actions a player can take.\n",
      "- Payoffs: the outcomes (often represented as utilities or profits) that players receive from a combination of actions.\n",
      "- Information: what players know when they choose their actions (perfect vs. imperfect information).\n",
      "- Rationality: the assumption that players aim to maximize their own payoffs.\n",
      "- Equilibrium: a stable outcome where no player wants to change their strategy given what others are doing (Nash equilibrium is the most common concept).\n",

      "Common types of games:\n",
      "- Normal-form (static) games: players choose simultaneously; payoffs depend on the combination of chosen strategies.\n",
      "- Extensive-form (dynamic) games: players move sequentially; the game is represented as a tree.\n",
      "- Cooperative vs. noncooperative: whether players can form binding agreements.\n",
      "- Zero-sum vs. general-sum: in zero-sum, one player’s gain is another’s loss; in general-sum, all can benefit or all can lose.\n",
      "- Complete vs. incomplete information: whether players know all relevant circumstances.\n",

      "Limitations:\n",
      "- Realistically, people may not be perfectly rational or have complete information.\n",

    "1. **Error Handling**: Wrap API calls in try-catch blocks with informative error messages\n",
    "2. **Response Caching**: Store responses in a dictionary to avoid repeated API calls with the same prompt\n",
    "3. **Token Counting**: Add a function to estimate token usage before making calls\n",
    "4. **Logging**: Track all API calls (prompts, responses, models used) to a file\n",
    "5. **Rate Limiting**: Add a small delay between calls to avoid hitting rate limits\n",

    "Consider these questions as you work through the exercises:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **On Emergence**: We saw emergent behavior in both ABMs (segregation from simple rules) and LLMs (reasoning from next-word prediction). Are these the same kind of emergence? How do they differ?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **On Agency**: What does it mean for an LLM to be an \"agent\"? Does it have goals? Preferences? Beliefs? Or are these anthropomorphizations?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **On Predictability**: Rule-based ABMs are deterministic but produce unpredictable aggregate outcomes. AI agents are stochastic but often produce predictable responses. What are the implications for simulation and modeling?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **On Control**: With rule-based agents, we control them by writing code. With AI agents, we control them by writing prompts. Which gives us more control? Which is more brittle?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **On Social Complexity**: If AI agents become widespread in social and economic systems, how might that change the dynamics? Will they amplify existing patterns or create new ones?\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll explore these questions more deeply throughout the module."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we've:\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ Distinguished between rule-based agents (traditional ABMs) and learning agents (LLMs)\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ Understood how LLMs work at a high level (next-word prediction → general reasoning)\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ Learned about transformer architecture and attention mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ Implemented basic LLM API calls in Julia (Anthropic and OpenAI)\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ Explored emergent capabilities: chain-of-thought reasoning and tool use\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ Compared the strengths and limitations of both agent paradigms\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ Connected AI agents to broader themes in complex systems\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **LLMs are trained on next-word prediction but develop general capabilities** - an example of emergence\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prompting is programming** - but in natural language with probabilistic outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Chain-of-thought and tool use** extend what agents can do beyond their training\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Rule-based and learning agents are complementary** - hybrid systems combine their strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Multi-agent AI systems** represent a new frontier in computational social science\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Lecture**: We'll explore how to augment AI agents with external knowledge using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), connecting to information networks and knowledge graphs."
