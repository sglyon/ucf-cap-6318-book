# Welcome

> Computational Analysis of Social Complexity
>
> Fall 2024, Spencer Lyon

Welcome to week 1!

This week we will get to know eachother and get on the same page with respect to what this class is all about.

We will also dive right in to the computational infrastructure we will need by installing the Julia programming langauge and learning a bit about how to use it.

Each week lecture notes will be distributed as a collection of Jupyter notebooks. The notebooks will follow a strict naming convention, where each notebook has a name such as `L@@_##_XXX.ipynb` where `@@` is a two digit lecture number and `##` is a two digit file number and `XXX` is one or more words describing the content of the notebook. We will work through the notebooks in the order indicated by the `##`. The `XXX` are to provide easier access when reviewing notes after class.

## About Me

- Spencer Lyon (<spencer.lyon@ucf.edu>)
- Economics PhD from NYU (2018)
- Love to teach: mostly economics, data science, AI/ML – all have
    programming/computational element
- Moved to Orlando in July 2018 with wife and 5 (yes!) kids
- Run consulting (training/projects) business:   Valorum Data
- Working on a couple startups

## About you

- Background?
- Progress in program?
- Areas of interest? (meaningful answers here! they matter…)
- Rumors about the course?

## About the course

- Interdisciplinary by nature
- "Living course": only been taught twice, content is flexible
  - More ideas/topics than time!
  - Has been altered fairly significantly since last year (but the heart/soul of the course remains the same)

- Theoretical concepts
  - Graphs: less detail than network science course
  - Game Theory: strategic interaction/competition
  - Social, information, financial networks

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

- Applications
  - Twitter
  - Economic markets and trade
        network
  - More...

## Expectations

- Take the time in the first 2 weeks to learn Julia
  - You'll be glad you did
  - Content moves quick and you don't want syntax/programming to distract you or hold you back
- Study reading assignments before class
- Complete assignments on time -- no exceptions
- Participate in in-class *discussions*
- Deliverables
  - Homework (9 – 30%)
  - Exam (1 – 30%)
  - Project (1 – 30%)
  - Citizenship (throughout - 10%)
    - First best: attend class in person, actively participate
    - Acceptable: attend virtually, but keep video on and be ready to speak up when called on
    - Unacceptable: attend virtually, but keep video off and/or don't participate in discussions
