    "### How Trading Works\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a traditional exchange (not Uniswap), trades are executed based off an order book\n",
    "    - Sellers of an asset post a sale price and amount\n",
    "    - Buyers post a purchase price and amount\n",
    "    - Whenever there is \"overlap\" on seller and buyer orders, a trade happens\n",
    "- Uniswap takes a different approach and is called an Automated Market Maker (AMM)\n",
    "    - Liqudity providers deposit 2 tokens into a pool (anyone can deposit into any pool)\n",
    "    - A **bonding curve** is used to quote prices of one token in terms of the other (e.g. tokenA/tokenB or tokenB/tokenA)\n",
    "    - Traders interact directly with the pool\n",
    "        - Tokens they are selling are deposited into pool\n",
    "        - Tokens they are buying are withdrawn\n",
    "    - A logic layer called the \"router\" allows one token to be swapped for any other one, even if there is not a pool between the two tokens \n",
    "        - e.g. CRV -> GRT might go through path CRV -> ETH -> USDC -> GRT\n",
    "        - Three pools are used CRV - ETH, ETH - USDC, USDC - GRT\n",
    "- Term AMM comes from fact that smart contract + mathematical equation execute trades automatically without any central entity needing to organize order book or execute trades"

    "- This is a key mathematical equation that dictates how reserves enter or leave the pool\n",
    "- The bonding curve used in Uniswap (and others like SushiSwap) is called the constant product rule: x * y = k\n",
    "- From the [uniswap V2 docs](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/V2/concepts/protocol-overview/how-uniswap-works)\n",
    "> Pairs act as automated market makers, standing ready to accept one token for the other as long as the “constant product” formula is preserved. This formula, most simply expressed as `x * y = k`, states that trades must not change the product (`k`) of a pair’s reserve balances (`x` and `y`). Because `k` remains unchanged from the reference frame of a trade, it is often referred to as the invariant. This formula has the desirable property that larger trades (relative to reserves) execute at exponentially worse rates than smaller ones.\n",
