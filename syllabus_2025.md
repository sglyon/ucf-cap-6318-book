## Getting Help

This course has a strong **support system** to help you when you run into problems --- and anyone who codes runs into problems. When (not if) you get stuck, we encourage you to reach out to the teacher, graduate assistant, the internet at large, and especially your classmates. We encourage you to post questions to the [Discussions page](https://webcourses.ucf.edu/courses/1490662/discussion_topics) on [WebCourses](https://webcourses.ucf.edu/)

The bottom line: **If you're stuck, ask for help**. Really. Don't be a hero, ask for help.

## Course Description

CAP 6318 ECS-EECS 3(3,0)Computational Analysis of Social Complexity: PR: CAP 5316. Computational concepts, principles, modeling and simulation approaches used to analyze complex social and economic phenomena, leveraging the availability of large amounts of data, and elements of complexity theory. Odd Spring.

CAP-6318 is a hands-on survey of a variety of topics in the fascinating field of computational social science. You will learn the theory behind modern network analysis, social network modeling, natural language processing, and game theory. Applications include some or all of: disease spread through geographic networks, information dissemination through social networks, computational analysis of strategic decision making, and more.

To implement our analysis we will use the exciting [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/). Julia is a relativelynew programming language (first public release 2012, v1.0 in 2018) targeted specifically at numerical computing. Julia combines Python-level friendly syntax with C-level execution speeds. Julia is a particularly good tool for the types of computations done in the social sciences: iterating over edges in a graph, simulating agent based models, etc. Prior programming experience is not required, but it will definitely help!

## Student Learning Outcomes

After successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Effectively read, write, and execute programs in the Julia programming language
- Arrange hierarchical, relationship oriented data into a graph or network
- Organize complex strategic interactions and scenarios into a structured representation using game theory
- Set up, simulate, and analyze outcomes for an agent based models
- Explain the key concepts of blockchain technology including public key cryptography, decentralized + distributed. ledgers, proof of work, proof of stake, smart contracts, decentralized finance, and non-fungible tokens
- Develop algorithms to solve tasks in networks science, agent based modeling, and game theory.

## Required Course Materials and Resources

## Course Assessment and Grading Procedure

Graded work for this course includes the following:

- **Homework (25%, drop lowest 1):** Throughout the course there will be *up to* 9 homework assignments. Homework is your opportunity to put the theories and hard skills into practice and make them your own. It is in your professional (and academic) best interest to commit to working hard on the homework assignments. You are encouraged to work in small groups on homework assignments, though each student will be required to submit their own work. Homework will always be assigned immediately after a class session and will be due 9 days later. This gives you ample time to work on the assignment and a class session in between the assignment date and the due date.
- **Class Participation (15%):** Each class session will include multiple opportunities for discussion, group work, and other engagement. Attendance and participation is expected. As we meet a total of 14 times throughout the semester, each class period will be worth 1%, with an additional 1% given for engaging in discussions and activities on Canvas. If you are unable to attend class for personal or professional reasons outside of your control, let me know beforehand and we will find a suitable substitute activity for you to earn your 1% for that day.
- **Exams (30%)**. There will be two oral exams. The first will take place between the 4th and 5th class meetings and the second will take place between the 13th and 14th class sessions. Each exam will administered individually and will take approximately 20-30 minutes per student. During the exam you will be asked to explain key concepts from the course, describe how you would solve application style questions, and solve short programming tasks.
- **Projects (30%)** The main purpose of this class is to prepare students to be able to formulate and execute computational analysis of social science questions. To that end, we will have 2 opportunities for students to develop projects with classmates. Projects will be assigned after class sessions 6 and 12 and you will have three weeks to complete each project. For each project you will be randomly assigned to a group with 1 or 2 other students. More details on how to complete the project will be given as we approach the project start date.

## Policies for Course Grade

### Makeup Work Policy

There will be no opportunity for makeup work. There are many assignments in this course, so a poor grade on any one assignment will not be too detrimental to your final grade.

### Missed/Late Assignments

I do not accept late work. If you are unable to complete an assignment on time, contact me and we will discuss options.

### Attendance

Attendance is mandatory. If you cannot See the "Participation" item in the grading section above for more information.

## Artificial Intelligence (AI) Use Policy

**Use of Generative AI (GenAI) is encouraged but must be disclosed**. Students are encouraged to use Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools on assignments if the usage is properly disclosed and credited. For example, text generated from Copilot should include a citation such as: “Copilot. Accessed 2023-12-03. Prompt: ‘Summarize the Geneva Convention in 50 words.’ Generated using Copilot.” Any attempt to represent GenAI output inappropriately as your own work will be treated as plagiarism. Ultimately, students are responsible for the accuracy and veracity of submitted work whether AI-generated or not.

In short -- use it, but include your prompts when submitting work!

Guidelines for maximally effective usage:

- DO use generative AI to help explain key concepts and generate examples or practice problems
- DO use generative AI to explore possible applications for projects
- DO NOT offload thinking or reasoning to AI. Thinking critically about issues and concepts is essential to learning. Never use AI to avoid this
- DO ask the AI tool to generate many examples or variations on a concept. AI is a great brainstorming partner and enabler, but ultimately you are in control
- DO know that you will be held accountable for anything you submit. Ultimately your name is on all assignments, so no excuses of "that's what the AI said" will be tolerated

## Recommended Work Habits

Computation and programming is not something you can learn from reading a book and attending lectures. You need to **write programs** --- the more the better --- to understand how they work. Think about how you'd learn to play basketball or soccer; reading and listening to lectures aren't enough, you need to do it. We'll do a lot of programming in class, but it's essential that you follow up outside of class. Here's how.

- **Write:** Shortly after class, write down everything you remember without looking at your notes or the book. Note things you don't understand --- gaps, we call them.
- **Review**: Read the relevant section of the book and lecture notes. Fill in the gaps. Ask for help with anything you still don't understand.

**Practice**. Some homework assignments may afford you the flexibility of choosing a subset of questions to complete for evaluation. This is our way of acknowledging that you have many commitments outside this class. We still suggest that you attempt all questions -- we view them as learning opportunities.

We also recommend you **practice coding** whenever you have the chance. Start small. Write short programs to do anything that crosses your mind. Use Julia to do things you would ordinarily do in another tool like Python or Excel. If permissable, try doing assignments from other courses in Julia. At first this will be more work than doing it by hand or in your current preferred tool, but once you have some experience it is our experience that things ar typically be easier in Julia. Even if that's not the case, the practice will expand your skill set.

## Class Schedule

The course is designed to be cover material at whatever pace the class is capable of. The topics should take roughly a week each, but we can scale that up or down as needed. If you're an expert, don't worry, we'll cover a lot of material either way.

## Disability Access & Accommodations

The University of Central Florida is committed to providing equal access to all students with disabilities (ADHD, learning disabilities, Autism, chronic medical conditions, physical disabilities, etc.). To receive consideration for reasonable disability-related course accommodations, disabled students must contact Student Accessibility Services (SAS) and complete the steps required for SAS to review accommodation requests. More information can be found on the UCF [Student Accessibility Services](https://sas.sswb.ucf.edu/get-connected/) website under the Start Here tab or by contacting SAS directly (Ferrell Commons 185; [sas@ucf.edu;](https://ucf.simplesyllabus.com/en-US/doc-preview/617e8319-14da-4900-a09c-d87b66384784/syllabus/) Phone - 407-823-2371).

Approved accommodations are shared with course instructors via the SAS Course Accessibility Letter. Implementing certain accommodations may require discussion about specific considerations of the course design, course learning objectives, and the individual academic and course challenges experienced by the student. While students with disabilities or chronic health needs are also encouraged to discuss any course concerns with professors in addition to contacting SAS, professors are not required to facilitate disability-related adjustments to the course unless the professor has received a Course Accessibility Letter from SAS that outlines approved accommodations.

## Academic Integrity

Students should familiarize themselves with UCF's Code of Conduct at Student Conduct and Integrity Office. According to Section 1, "Academic Misconduct," students are prohibited from engaging in:

1. Academic misconduct is defined as any submitted work or behavior that obstructs the instructor of record's ability to accurately assess the student's understanding or completion of course materials or degree requirements (e.g., assignment, quiz, and/or exam). Examples of academic misconduct include but are not limited to: plagiarism, unauthorized assistance to complete an academic exercise; unauthorized communication with others during an examination, course assignment, or project; falsifying or misrepresenting academic work; providing misleading information to create a personal advantage to complete course/degree requirements; or multiple submission(s) of academic work without permission of the instructor of record.
2. Any student who knowingly helps another violate academic behavior standards is also in violation of the standards.
3. Commercial Use of Academic Material. Selling of course material to another person and/or uploading course material to a third-party vendor without authorization or without the express permission of the University and the instructor of record. Course materials include but are not limited to class notes, the instructor of record's slide deck, tests, quizzes, labs, instruction sheets, homework, study guides, and handouts.
4. Soliciting assistance with academic coursework and/or degree requirements. The solicitation of assistance with an assignment, lab, quiz, test, paper, etc., without authorization of the instructor of record or designee is prohibited. This includes but is not limited to asking for answers to a quiz, trading answers, or offering to pay another to complete an assignment. It is considered Academic Misconduct to solicit assistance with academic coursework and/or degree requirements, even if the solicitation did not yield actual assistance (for example, if there was no response to the solicitation).

#### Responses to Academic Dishonesty, Plagiarism, or Cheating

Students should also familiarize themselves with the procedures for academic misconduct in UCF's student handbook, [The Golden Rule](https://goldenrule.sswb.ucf.edu/). UCF faculty members have a responsibility for students' education and the value of a UCF degree, and so seek to prevent unethical behavior and respond to academic misconduct when necessary. Penalties for violating rules, policies, and instructions within this course can range from a zero on the exercise to an "F" letter grade in the course. In addition, an Academic Misconduct report could be filed with the Office of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity, which could lead to disciplinary warning, disciplinary probation, or deferred suspension or separation from the University through suspension, dismissal, or expulsion with the addition of a "Z" designation on one's transcript.

Being found in violation of academic conduct standards could result in a student having to disclose such behavior on a graduate school application, being removed from a leadership position within a student organization, the recipient of scholarships, participation in University activities such as study abroad, internships, etc.

Let's avoid all of this by demonstrating values of honesty, trust, and integrity. No grade is worth compromising your integrity and moving your moral compass. Stay true to doing the right thing: take the zero, not a shortcut.

## Title IX

Title IX prohibits sex discrimination, including sexual misconduct, sexual violence, sexual harassment, and retaliation. If you or someone you know has been harassed or assaulted, you can find resources available to support the victim, including confidential resources and information concerning reporting options at [Let's Be Clear](http://www.shield.ucf.edu/) and [UCF Cares](http://cares.sdes.ucf.edu/).

## Deployed Active-Duty Military Students

Students who are deployed active-duty military and/or National Guard personnel and require accommodation should contact their instructors as soon as possible after the semester begins and/or after they receive notification of deployment to make arrangements.

## Campus Safety

At UCF's Public Safety and Police, safety is the top priority. Emergencies on campus are rare, but if one should arise, it's important to be familiar with some basic safety and security concepts.

- In an emergency, always dial 911.
- Every UCF Classroom has an Emergency Procedure Guide posted on a wall near the door, which will show you how to respond to a variety of situations. This guide can also be found found online [here](https://police.ucf.edu/about-us/department-of-emergency-management/emergency-guides).
- In the event of an active threat, remember **AVOID**, **DENY**, **DEFEND**. Choose the best course of action and act immediately. Watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uU7yqZmMuc) to learn more.
 	- **AVOID**. Pay attention to your surroundings and have an exit plan. Get as much distance and as many barriers between you and the threat as quickly as possible.
 	- **DENY**. When avoiding is difficult or impossible, deny the threat access to you and your space. Lockdown by creating barriers, turning the lights off and remaining quiet and out of sight. Make sure your cell phone is silenced, but do not turn it off.
 	- **DEFEND**. When you are unable to put distance between yourself and the threat, be prepared to protect yourself. Commit to your actions, be aggressive and do not fight fairly. Do whatever it takes to survive.
- For emergencies on campus, UCF will utilize the [UCF Alert](https://police.ucf.edu/ucfalert) system. All UCF students, faculty, and staff are automatically enrolled to receive these email and text alerts, however, it's a good idea to frequently ensure your [contact information is up to date](http://www.getrave.com/login/ucf).

## Financial Aid Accountability

All instructors/faculty are required to document students' academic activity at the beginning of each course. In order to document that you began this course, please complete this activity by the end of the first week of classes or as soon as possible after adding the course. Failure to do so may result in a delay in the disbursement of your financial aid.
