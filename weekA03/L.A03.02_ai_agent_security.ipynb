    "- A \"zero-click\" attack on Microsoft 365 Copilot\n",
    "- A single email, automatically scanned in the background, exfiltrated sensitive Fortune 500 corporate data\n",
    "- The user had **no idea** their AI assistant was compromised\n",
    "- The attack worked by embedding hidden instructions in emails\n",
    "- Copilot followed the attacker's instructions instead of the user's intent\n",

    "\n",
    "Three components that, when combined, create critical security risks:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Access to Private Data**\n",
    "- Your agent can read sensitive information\n",
    "- Databases, filesystems, APIs, user data\n",
    "- Remember Week A2? `RunContext` with database connections\n",
    "- Tools that retrieve confidential information\n",

    "- RAG systems ingesting unverified data (Week A1)\n",
    "- Any content from sources you don't fully control\n",

    "**3. Ability to Exfiltrate Data**\n",
    "- Your agent can communicate externally\n",

    "\n",

    "- This part is from an external source (potentially malicious)\n",
    "\n",
