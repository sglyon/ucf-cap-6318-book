    "- Many topics of interest for social scientists are either unethical or unreasonable to study in a laboratory\n",
    "  - Impact on communities of upsurge in illicit drug usage (can't give people drugs to see impact)\n",
    "  - Flow of traffic given a new infrastructure updates (too costly to experiment with)\n",
    "  - Impact of new tarrifs in international trading relationships (too costly to coorindate legislation and implement)\n",
    "- For this reason, we as social scientists turn to *models* to study our problems\n",
    "- A model is a probability distribution over outcomes\n",

    "- A model is a mathematical object: equations, rules, distributional assumptions.\n",
    "- At its heart, a model is a simplification of some real-world system or phenonmenom\n",
    "  - Much complexity is abstracted away (or not included directly in model)\n",
    "  - Key aspects relevant for study are modeled explicitly (e.g. trading response to tarrifs)\n",

    "  - Equation based models\n",
    "  - Agent based models\n",

    "\n",
    "- An equation based model describes the decision making setting for each agent using mathematical equations\n",
    "- Typically, these are posed as (constrained) optimization problems\n",
    "- A set of equaitons is also developed that describe interaction between agents\n",
    "- These equations can feature random variables and will require specification of model parameters\n",
    "- Most models I study and develop in my economics research are equation based\n",
    "- Pros:\n",
    "  - Allow precise specification of assumptions, incentives, and outcomes\n",
    "  - Have wide toolbox of numerical optimization, and statistical fitting to \"solve\" model\n",
    "- Cons:\n",
    "  - Optimization and calibration of parameters can be very difficult\n",
    "  - Often subject to the \"curse of dimensionality\", which limits size and complexity of model"

    "### Agent Based Models (ABMs)\n",
    "\n",
    "- An agent based model describes rules for how individual agents respond to their environment\n",
    "- There are usually many agents, each with a set of properties\n",
    "- One common property is the *type* of the agent: usually drawn from a small/finite set (buyer-seller, parent-child-teacher, sheep-wolf)\n",
    "- All agents of the same type have the same set of additional properties\n",
    "- Each agent has a *state* at each time step $t$\n",
    "- The *rules* are equations that specify how the state of an agent is updated between periods $t$ and $t+1$\n",
    "  - Rules are common for all agents of a type, but vary based on that agent's state and property values\n",
    "  - Rules will often have random variables as well as parameters\n",
    "  - Rules often include notion of \"neighboring\" agents\n",
    "- Pros:\n",
    "  - Focus on how an individual should respond in a given state without *requiring* optimization\n",
    "  - Because rules are typically mathematically simple, can have many many agents\n",
    "- Cons:\n",
    "  - Often lacks notion of equilibrium (could be a feature)\n",
    "  - Not very \"reusable\" -- to study specific topic you usually have to create whole new model\n",
    "  - Sometimes [too many parameters](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2970219/was-von-neumann-right-that-with-four-parameters-you-can-fit-an-elephant): need for careful calibration"
